        Non-Qualified Mortgage (Non-QM) loans are designed for borrowers who do not fit the strict guidelines of conventional loans. These loans offer flexibility in terms of income verification, 
        credit requirements, and underwriting standards, making them ideal for individuals with unique financial situations. With Non-QM loans, self-employed individuals, real estate investors, 
        and those with non-traditional income streams can access mortgage financing, opening the door to homeownership and real estate investments for a broader range of borrowers.

                                    Non-Qualified Mortgage (Non-QM) loans are financial products that serve borrowers who do not qualify 
                                    for conventional loans under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Qualified Mortgage (QM) standards. 
                                    They allow for alternative documentation, such as bank statements, to verify income, and often accommodate higher 
                                    debt-to-income ratios, irregular income sources, and less-than-perfect credit. Non-QM loans serve as an alternative 
                                    for individuals whose financial profiles deviate from traditional lending models.

                                     <p> Borrowers only pay interest for a specific period, reducing initial monthly payments. However, this structure may result in a larger loan balance over time. </p>

                                         <p>Ideal for self-employed individuals or those with fluctuating income, these loans use bank statements to verify income rather than traditional documentation. .</p>

                                        <p>Tailored for real estate investors, these loans assess the income potential of the property rather than the borrowerâ€™s personal income. </p>
                                    
                                        <span className="Mortgage mb-1">  Alt-A Loans:</span>
                                        <p>Offering greater flexibility in underwriting, these loans allow higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and more lenient credit requirements, benefiting borrowers with complex financial profiles. .</p>
