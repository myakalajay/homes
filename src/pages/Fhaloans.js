        FHA loans, insured by the Federal Housing Administration, are an attractive option for first-time homebuyers and individuals with less-than-perfect credit. 
        These loans feature low down payment requirements, sometimes as low as 3.5%, and offer more lenient credit standards compared to conventional mortgages. 
        FHA loans are also assumable, which can simplify the home selling process. However, borrowers must be aware of additional costs, including upfront 
        and monthly mortgage insurance premiums (MIP), which can increase the total loan expense.

                                    An FHA loan is a mortgage loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), designed to help low-
                                    to moderate-income borrowers who may have less-than-perfect credit or limited savings. These loans feature lower 
                                    down payments and less stringent borrowing criteria compared to conventional loans, making homeownership more accessible. 
                                    However, borrowers are required to pay mortgage insurance premiums and must purchase homes that meet FHA standards.
